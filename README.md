VideoMessageExporter
====================

VideoMessage Exporter is an OSX app to export/download Skype video messages.

**NOTE:** Due to changes in the Skype database (and lack of time on my end), I've had to compromise on the ease-of-use. The newer style video messages will not automatically download, but will instead open on a new web browser window. You must login with your Skype username/password on the Skype website to view them. Once it is playing you can **right click** the video and select **download video** in order to get it.

You can also go to the following directory to get the cached files directly **/Users/alvaro/Library/Application\ Support/Skype/(skype username)/media_messaging/media_cache_v3**
I couldn't figure out how to relate them to a username/date, so I decided not to do it.

Usage:

1 - Run skype and play the video messages you want to download (otherwise the download link will not be valid)

2 - Run VideoMessage Exporter

3 - Select the video messages you want to download from the list and click the "Download Selected" button.

4 - The files will be saved to your desktop


Supported versions - OSX 10.7 and above


If you get the ERROR 401, view the message you want in skype, hit the refresh files button, and try again.
